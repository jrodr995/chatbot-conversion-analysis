Sanitized Presentation Assets
=============================

This folder holds sanitized screenshots from the original internal presentation. These images contain no PII, credentials, or proprietary table names.

Add your screenshots here
-------------------------
- Place PNG/JPG files in `presentation/screenshots/`.
- Use short filenames (e.g., `agent_vs_appointments.png`, `pattern_table.png`, `agent_features.png`).
- Optional: add a short caption in `captions.md` mapping filename → caption.

Sanitization checklist
----------------------
- No company/customer names, emails, phone numbers, or URLs.
- Remove/blur schema/table names; keep placeholders (`DB.SCHEMA.TABLE`).
- Keep dates/timeframes if they aren’t sensitive.
- Replace specific location references with generic wording if needed.

Attribution note
----------------
These screenshots are sanitized reproductions of an internal analysis presentation. The public repo demonstrates methods and findings without exposing proprietary content.
